        <description>Professional solution for collecting and analyzing trace data 

dbForge Event Profiler for SQL Server is a free add-in for SSMS designed to trace and analyze events in SQL Server. The purpose of this mini-tool is to detect problems related to SQL Server and identify their causes. Event Profiler can track all sessions on servers and queries executed there, and define all bottlenecks. 

Users can identify which queries affect the server performance most, and inspect them in-depth. Also, it is possible to track the users&#8217; activities and their impact on the SQL Server resources. As proper audit is essential for proper database management, Event Profiler helps in this aspect significantly. 

The tool is also a part of the dbForge Studio for SQL Server &#8211; a powerful IDE that is more functional than SSMS.</description>
