        <description>The tool for detecting and analyzing index fragmentation issues

dbForge Index Manager for SQL Server is another add-in for SSMS that targets index fragmentation issues and lets the users detect and fix issues within SSMS. You can quickly define all indexes with problems and rebuild them to fix them. The solution allows you to do it manually, in a visual mode, or automatedly, with the specific SQL scripts generated by the Index Manager. Users can apply them at once or save them to use in the future. 

The Index Manager analyzes the databases in-depth and returns full statistics on detected index fragmentation issues, sorted by the severity of problems. Users can export the reports on fragmentation for future analysis. All tasks on detecting and fixing the issues can be automated through the command line. 

The tool is a part of the SQL Tools package, and it is also available as a separate solution integrated with SSMS. A free trial is provided for the tool. </description>
