        <description>The monitoring tool for tracking SQL Server performance

dbForge Monitor for SQL Server is a free enhancement for SSMS that helps you track the performance of SQL Server in real-time, analyze it, and identify any problems and their causes. This add-in can monitor the status of all servers and databases and provide you with detailed stats data, including the memory and CPU utilization. 

Users can review the overall SQL Server performance and dive deeper to diagnose some issues at once. Slow TSQL queries and other issues get noticed at once, and it takes several seconds to identify and resolve them. The tracking and analyzing processes are automated. No problem passes unnoticed. 

The Monitoring tool is one of the most helpful SQL tools. You can get it free of charge to improve the functionality of your SSMS and your DBA routines.
