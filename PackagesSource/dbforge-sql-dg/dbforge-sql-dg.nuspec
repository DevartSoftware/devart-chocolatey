        <description>A powerful generator of meaningful test data 

dbForge Data Generator for SQL Server allows for quick automated production of realistic test data in any amount. The software includes more than 200 predefined generators of SQL data and allows for adding custom generators. It is worth mentioning the Python Generator that uses an IronPython script for data generation. It has its predefined Basic settings and also Custom settings. Users can change them both to adjust the generator's work for their custom needs. It also supports the RegexGenerator, allowing you to use regular expressions with Python Generator.

 New custom generators can be created, configured, and shared across the team. 

The flexible configuration of the generators ensures that the test data will match the purpose and stay consistent across all tables. Besides, the data in columns are based on data in other columns for better performance of all tests. Users can automate the data generation routines and run them by schedule. 

The Data Generation tool is a part of the SQL Tools package. Besides, it is one of the features available in dbForge Studio for SQL Server. Users can also get this tool separately and integrate it into SSMS to use the powers of data generation in their habitual IDE.  </description>
